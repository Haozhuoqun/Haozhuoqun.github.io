Seagull 203 was first launched in 1963 in Shanghai. Since there's no stop mechanism in film advance lever, it could switch the format bewteen 645 or 6x6 before loading the film. The camera features an 'EV' chart written in Chinese which is pretty unique. 

There's no way to focus using thumb, which is not common in 1960 rangefinder cameras, but the bright side is that the coupling between lens focus ring and rangefinder is simple and not easy to fail.
